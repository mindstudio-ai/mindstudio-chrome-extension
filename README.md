# How to get started

```
npm run build

1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Load Unpacked, Choose "dist"
```

# Sean New Version
Leaving current code in place for reference for now, but the new code is in `/new`.

No build step, just clone, open `chrome://extensions/` in browser, choose `Load Unpacked` and select `new` as the folder.
